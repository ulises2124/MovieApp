The project has the required functionality, a Viper architecture was used since the elements are worked in a more organized way and is the design pattern that best fits, also i used SOLID concepts to keep clean the code.  
Third-party libraries were not used.
The code is totally native.
I use code views to provide better handling of visual elements. 
The networking layer is totally made by me, which absorbs the complexity to give more functionality to the layers of the interactor.

The cache part is implemented by default, I did not see it necessary to use any storage as coredata since the complexity of the project does not require it.
